**Assessment Premise**: 

**TLDR; Take the functions from [R Programming I](https://github.com/Bioinformatics-Research-Network/R-Programming-I) and turn them into a package called "BioUtils"**

After you completed the tasks your supervisor gave you in [R Programming I](https://github.com/Bioinformatics-Research-Network/R-Programming-I), you get a call from HR. Apparently, your functions were so useful that you have been promoted from a Bioinformatics Assistant to Bioinformatics Associate üöÄ. Your first task will be to turn your `utils.R` script into a package, `BioUtils`, for the whole bioinformatics team to use üéØ. The package should contain all the functions you wrote in `utils.R`, but properly formatted as an R package and well-documented. This will enable your colleagues to easily install your package and use the functions contained within!

Users will use your package like so:

```R
library(BioUtils)

cancer <- "ATCGCATACGA"
normal <- "ATCCCAGATGA"

protein_variant(cancer, normal)
```


### Automated testing / checking

Prior to releasing the package, your new supervisor will make sure that everything works correctly and that it is well-formatted/documented. She will deploy a bot to run automated checks on your package -- they should produce no errors, warnings, or notes.

<details>
<summary>Automated checks</summary>

The bot will initiate an `R v4.2.0` session and install `BioUtils` package by running:

```R
devtools::build()
```

Then it will test the package by running:

```R
devtools::test()
```

Next, it will run CRAN checks:

```R
devtools::check(cran = TRUE, error_on="note")
````

Next, it will check the style of the package using `lintr` from the linux command line:

```shell
Rscript -e "errors <- lintr::lint_package(); print(errors); quit(save = 'no', status = length(errors))"
```

</details>


## Guidance

Most guidance for this assessment is identical to [R Programming I](https://github.com/Bioinformatics-Research-Network/R-Programming-I), with the following additions:

Due to naming conventions in R packages, it is a very good idea to clone this github repository with the name `BioUtils` specified for the output directory:

```shell
git clone <link_to_repo> BioUtils
```

### Additional resources

To learn about building and documenting R packages, visit the following link: [R packages book](https://r-pkgs.org/)

The easiest way to complete this assignment is to make heavy usage of the `usethis` R package: [link](https://usethis.r-lib.org/). For example, it is strongly recommended to begin this task by running `usethis::create_package()`. When adding new datasets to the package, it is recommended to run `usethis::use_data_raw()` to initialize them.

### Getting help

If you find a bug or get confused, please don't hesitate to contact the BRN Skill Assessment maintainers on the **#help-skill-assessments** Slack channel, and they will assist you.
